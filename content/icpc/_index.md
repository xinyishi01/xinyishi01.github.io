I started training for the Olympiad in Informatics (OI) in my first year of high school, and I wrote a Chinese [blog](https://www.cnblogs.com/Serene-shixinyi) to document what I learned and how I felt along the way. In college, I became especially drawn to the ACM/ICPC-style team format. I also served as the leader of a women’s team in my freshman year and as a student coach in my junior year.

Through these contests, I found that I am best at problems that require careful case analysis and meticulous implementation. I enjoy simplifying code by merging cases and systematically handling boundary and corner cases, which often leads to cleaner logic and more robust solutions.

In recent years, I still enjoy participating in Codeforces contests (Div.1 / Div.2), and I’m always happy to meet new friends to practice and solve problems together.
